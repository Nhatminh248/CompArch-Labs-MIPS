# Computer Architecture Lab - MIPS (MARS)

## Introduction

This report presents the results of Lab 2, which focused on:

- Implementing conditional branch and jump instructions in MIPS assembly.

- Writing and calling procedures.

- Using recursion in MIPS program.
.
### The exercises involved writing programs for:

1. Character Frequency Counting: Counting occurrences of each character in a string and sorting the output.

2. GCD and LCM Calculation: Computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) and least common multiple (LCM) using recursion.

3. Finding the Second Largest Element in an Array: Identifying the second largest value and its positions in a user-provided array.

Additionally, user input was validated by handling input as a string and ensuring only valid values were processed before performing calculations.

For further clarification, refer the comments in the source code.
